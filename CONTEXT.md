# LesPetitsPlats project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

After publishing cookery books for several years, the company decided to embark on a new project: to create its own cookery recipe website like Marmiton or 750g.

### My role

You are a freelancer and you have just been assigned by the company "Les petits plats" as a Front-end Developer for a 3 month mission.

For this project I got a model, a JSON file with 50 recipes and a use case decription of the research element.

I had to create the app from scratch so I used HTML SASS and JavaScript. I was asked to make a functionality investigation sheet where I would compare two different types of research algorithme by making schematics, coding them and doing some benchmark to see which one perform better.

So I got to display the recipes of the JSON file and create a research element to filter the recipes, you can also research recipes by selecting a tag, every tags and recipes displayed had to be based on the filtred recipes.
